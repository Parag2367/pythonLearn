"""
Problem statement
Youâ€™re given a linked list. The last node might point to null, or it might point to a node in the list, thus forming a cycle.

Find out whether the linked list has a cycle or not, and the length of the cycle if it does.

If there is no cycle, return 0, otherwise return the length of the cycle.

Example:
Input: Linked List: 4 -> 10 -> 3 -> 5 -> 10(at position 2)

Output: Length of cycle = 3

Explanation: The cycle is 10, 3, 5.
